# checkHistory
Run history as it is irl

Goes through whole existent history 
_(.db file with history should be in directory, path is declared in constants.h)_
, taking into account some limitations

Nice idea to refactor with using blocks with "conditionals" which will be rotated into all possible combinations and checked history with it.
